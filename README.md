# Prismatic Jane Eyre - IBM Translation Models

This project applies IBM Models 1 and 2 to analyze translations of Charlotte BrontÃ«'s _Jane Eyre_ across multiple languages, focusing on how key words and phrases evolve across different translations.

## Project Overview

Using statistical word alignment models, this project examines French and Italian translations of _Jane Eyre_ to trace how specific words and their contexts change across different translators and time periods. The goal is to provide computational support for literary translation analysis.

## Data

The Jane Eyre translation corpus includes:

- Multiple French translations (1854-2008)
- Multiple Italian translations (1904-2014)
- Aligned sentence pairs between English source and translations

## Implementation

### IBM Models

This implementation builds upon code from [IBM-Models by daandouwe](https://github.com/daandouwe/IBM-Models), originally developed for the UvA NLP2 course. The models have been adapted for literary text analysis.

### Key Features

- IBM Model 1 and 2 implementation with EM parameter estimation
- Word pair extraction with probability thresholds
- Context extraction for translation analysis
- Visualization of alignment probabilities

## Usage

### Training IBM Model 1

```bash
python run-ibm1.py
```

### Training IBM Model 2

```bash
python run-ibm2.py
```

### Extracting Word Contexts

```bash
python extract_word_contexts.py
```
